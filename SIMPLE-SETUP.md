Hopefully this is a good take on the simplest approach to cutting the cord.

## Expectations:
This is the minimum to have a decent (in my opinion) setup where you can manage your own library of media. DO NOT expect to play 4k content.

## Steps

For this you can get an old computer, or a new raspberry Pi.

Depending on how much media you expect to have, you may want to buy an external drive with enough storage.
