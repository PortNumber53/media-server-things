My take on cutting the cord


Things you'll need to know (to make my life easier):

- basic computer skills (create folder, navigate file system, download files, find the files you downloaded)
- basic linux skills (uncompress a file, edit text files, running scripts)
- optional: basic building your own computer skills (you're able to buy computer parts and put them together, as opposed to buying something off the shelf)
- time

#### Some of my assumptions:
- You understanding not owning the media you have in your media center is illegal, and I don't take any blame for what you're doing with these instructions.
- You have enough common sense.
- You won't take everything I write literally.


Like most things in life, you can take your own project in different directions, therefore I'll try to make it clear on decisions you'll need to make when you can choose different than I did.

First thing to consider:
1) Do you want to have a media player just for your own use, or are you planning on sharing your library with people, and if sharing with how many people. Do you have a guess on how many people would be watching at the same time?
This is important because: if you're the only one consuming your library, then you won't need a fast internet connection, and moderate hardware (even a raspberry Pi) should be enough.
If you plan on sharing your library with friends and family, you'll need fast upload speeds and beefier hardware.



## Simple setup:
You'll need:
- a computer to be your media server
- a smart TV
- internet connection

1) Build a computer (called *Server*)  with enough storage
2) create an account at https://plex.tv
3) install Plex Media Server on the *Server*
4) install Plex on your smart TV

## More complicated setup:
You'll need:
- lots of storage, cluster of computers, etc
- smart TVs
- internet connection(s)
